My research interests lie under the uber-umbrella of Artifical Intelligence spanning across Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning.\nApart from this, I am fond of reading and writing and especially enjoy techno-philosophical content. I define techno-philosophy as weaving of fascinating technical principles, concepts and insights into relatable and ingenious philosophies. An example would be this quote, “Life is like Quicksort, it will place you at your right position in some pass. Just be patient till you get to be the pivot.” This was written by my undergrad version back then and since that time I have been trying to improve this skill with more maturity and depth. Additionally, I am interested in Music, especially Indian Classical form.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a student currently pursuing MS by research at IIT Madras, under the guidance of Dr. Mitesh M.

There is a mega-reward for successfully picking and dropping passengers and penalties for bumping into walls or wrong drops. We use prinicples of Reinforcement Learning to train an agent with different algorithms and meaure the performance at this task. We implement a random agent, a SARSA agent, a Q-learning agent and a smart Q-learning agent for this problem and present a performance comparison analysis. The smart Q-learning agent has few improvements(over the standard version) to better handle the exploration-exploitation trade off and help achieve good performance within less iterations. Moreover, experiments are done to choose the best set of hyper parameters for this problem using Grid search technique.\nSlides\n","date":1560426181,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560426181,"objectID":"a515b62efba9c09629ffed409ad59fe0","permalink":"/project/rl-proj/rl-project/","publishdate":"2019-06-13T17:13:01+05:30","relpermalink":"/project/rl-proj/rl-project/","section":"project","summary":"This project explores a Taxi environment where there is a requirement to pick and drop passengers to specific locations, maneuvering through open roads with the aim of efficiently scheduling trips.
